### Initialise Network

A network is a set of rules that govern the creation of a promisor. A network can create an unlimited number of promisors as long as the promisor fulfills the rules defined by the network. This follows the same paradigm as Metaplex Candy Guard. 

Example: Create a network for a Dapp that will only onboard promisors that fulfill the Dapps requirements. i.e Only users with an SMB after a certain date are allowed to create an account and participate on the platform

Current rules include:
- Start date
- End date
- Token gate (WIP)
