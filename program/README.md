The Promise Protocol lies at the core of two x two, with the fundamental goal of addressing a crucial human need - accountability. Recognizing the priceless nature of time, the protocol seeks to tackle this need by providing a proven idea for fulfilling promises.

### Promise network

The Promise Network is a system that operates based on predefined rules, allowing anyone who meets the network's criteria to become a Promisor and join.

### Promisor

A Promisor within the network has the ability to create promises according to a specific set of rules, while a Promisee can only accept a promise provided they fulfill the criteria outlined within it.

### Promise

A promise, simply put, is a commitment created by the Promisor that outlines the requirements agreed upon by the Promisee.

### Promisee

The Promisee is the individual who accepts the promise and agrees to abide by the rules outlined within it.

## Example use case

Let's use a DAO as an example of how it could implement the Promise protocol. The DAO would initiate a Promise with a set of rules and a corresponding reward. The rules would typically require the promisee to meet certain conditions such as being a member of the DAO, holding an OkayBear, and staking SOL.

The reward offered by the DAO could include its own currency as well as SOL tokens. If the promisee fulfills the promise by meeting the stipulated conditions, they receive the promised reward. However, if they fail to meet the conditions, they lose their stake.

The rule engine is a critical component of this protocol, and we invite you to explore the code further. It powers various applications, including the popular two-by-two paddle game.
